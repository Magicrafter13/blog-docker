You now have a blog that works with Markdown posts stored in a SQL database. See
[the GitLab page](https://gitlab.matthewrease.net/matthew/blog-docker) for more
detailed setup instructions. But the tl;dr is that you can mount a volume to
`/app/posts`, and place special Markdown files in there. The file-names should
consist only of digits, and the format of the files is shown below:

Markdown content here
```

This is a special format which prefixes the Markdown data with metadata in yaml.
The title and description are shown on the blog home page as well as social
media embeds. The preview is only shown on the blog home page as the first
paragraph. The seconds column of the timestamps is not used, but is stored in
the database. The `edited` field should be updated whenever a post is changed,
but the `published` field should never be changed once set in the database.

The `image-alt` string is for accessibility and should describe the contents of
the post's image, if deemed important. Markdown headings should begin with level
1 in the document, but will be shifted to the correct level when displayed on
the site for accessibility.

A docker volume should be mounted at `/app/posts` that contains all the
`############.md` files, and a volume should be mounted at `/app/blog/images`
that contains all of the `############.webp` files. There is no metadata to
associate an image with a post, they simply need to have matching filenames
(ignoring the extension). At this time `.webp` files are required.
